From the above correlations and the plots in part (d), from my point of view I think USD_JPY and USD_AUD tend to move opposite direction whereas beta of USD_GBP tends to move together.

I think the result does make sense, the reason can be of the correlations above and also the trends of the plots and the values of the beta coefficients.
