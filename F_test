Final Verdict:

Based on the null hypothesis only beta(1) value of model # 2 will be applicable, and then after looking at the above-mentioned P-values for both the models which are below 5% I will still pick model #2 since its P(value) is more less than the P(value) of Model#1. As shown below:


P(Value) of Model #1: 1.687e-05
P(Value) of Model #2: 1.102e-05
